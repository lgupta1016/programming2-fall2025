        <h1 id="header">Our Goal</h1>
        <p id="maintext1">A successful high school golf team strives to develop both individual skills and collective strength throughout each season. The <i><b>Francis W Parker Boys Golf Team</b></i> aims to consistently lower scores through dedicated practice, master course management under pressure, and build the mental resilience that golf demands. Beyond personal improvement, the goal is to compete at the highest level possible—whether that's winning conference championships, advancing to state tournaments, or simply outperforming last year's results. Equally important is fostering a supportive team culture where players encourage each other, maintain integrity through honest scorekeeping, and represent their school with sportsmanship. Ultimately, the team seeks to create an environment where every member finishes the season as a better golfer and teammate than when they started.</p>
