	<h4>Description</h4>
		<p class="first">A sloppy joe is a classic American sandwich made by cooking ground beef with onions, tomato sauce or ketchup, and seasonings, then serving it warm on a soft hamburger bun. The result is a savory, tangy, and slightly messy meal that’s quick, comforting, and perfect for weeknight dinners.</p>

	<h4>Ingredients</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
			<li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
			<li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
			<li>¾ cup ketchup, or to taste</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard, or to taste</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
			<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>Steps</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat.</li> 
			<li>Cook and stir lean ground beef in the hot skillet until some of the fat starts to render, 3 to 4 minutes.</li> 
			<li>Add onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables have softened and beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes.</li>

			<li>Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>

			<li>Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.</li>

		</ol>
