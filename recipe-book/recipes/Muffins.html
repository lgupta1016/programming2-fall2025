	<h4>Description</h4>
	<p>Muffins are soft, moist baked goods similar to cupcakes but typically less sweet and more bread-like. They can be made with a variety of mix-ins like blueberries, chocolate chips, or nuts for endless flavor combinations.</p>

	<h4>Ingredients</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
	  <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
	  <li>2 large eggs</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
	  <li>1/2 cup sour cream or yogurt</li>
	  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
	  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
	  <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
	  <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	  <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
	  <li>1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Steps</h4>
	<ol>
	  <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners.</li>
	  <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter and sugar until well combined.</li>
	  <li>Add the eggs, milk, sour cream (or yogurt), and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.</li>
	  <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
	  <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined.</li>
	  <li>Gently fold in the blueberries.</li>
	  <li>Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.</li>
	  <li>Bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
	  <li>Let muffins cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
	</ol>
